# IoC : Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection

In this project, there are sample examples to explain different ways to implement Inversion of Control Principle in order to 
achieve loose coupling between application classes. 

* [IoC using Factory](./Factory)
* [IoC using Dependency Injection (DI)](./DependencyInjection)
* [IoC using Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./DependencyInversion)
* [IoC using Unity Container](./UnityContainer)

To learn more about the Injection of dependence (DI), I advise you my topic on Medium
[Understanding Dependency Injection with C#](https://medium.com/@abdelmajid.baco/understanding-dependency-injection-with-c-7da4ad9986e9)
